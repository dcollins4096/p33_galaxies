1.) Write a simple code that uses OMP and MPI to compute pi.  Test the hybrid
parallelism.  Should set something up on just one thread per node, do some work
using OMP, and collect some result using MPI.
2.) Write the hierarchy parser.  Fill the grid array with the important
coordinates.
3.) Write the distributer.  Each node gets some subset of grids, should be
balanced.  Doesn't matter a ton, to be frank.
4.) Write the grid reader.  Make it better than the Enzo reader.
5.) Write the field object and quantity maker.  
6.) Write the zero_under_subgrid code.
7.) Write the serializer.
8.) Figure out the right computational geometry library to use.  We need a
convex hull and polygon intersection tools.  Might as well make sure it has a
delauny triangulation when I eventually decide to do it that way.  Probably
qhull.
9.) Re-code the projector.  Do it on one node.
10.) Write the map collector.
11.) ???
12.) Profit.
