Each main thread (one per node) decides what grids it gets.
In Enzo, grid_id starts with all the root grid tiles, then is in creation order.
For now, our grids are pretty regular in size, so we can simply do:
my_grid_list = (grid_id_list % total_node_count == my_processor_number)

Another choice is to create a list of work_per_grid and walk down the grid list
giving each node approximately the same amount of work.
